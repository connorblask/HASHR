# HASHR
### A simple hashing and analysis tool that runs within a single PowerShell window.

HASHR uses PowerShell hashing algorithms to provide multiple differrent hashes of the same file. Some of these hashes can be directly uploaded to VirusTotal for on the fly file analysis.

# How to Use
1. Add HASHR to the same directory as the file you would like to hash and/or analyze.
2. Edit the HASHR script and put in your own API Key. The variable "$yekIPA" should be set to your API key wrapped in quotation marks.
3. Run the script, follow the prompts, and enjoy!
